GPU-Optimized Convolution from Scratch

Project Description: This project implements 2D and 3D convolutional layers from scratch in CUDA, optimized for modern GPU architectures with tensor cores. It includes naive and optimized implementations, im2col transformation, and GEMM using Tensor cores (WMMA API), with profiling and comparison against cuDNN.

🚀 Features

Naive Implementation: 2D/3D convolution kernel in CUDA using global memory.

Profile: High latency, low occupancy.

Basic Optimizations:

Constant Memory: Used for kernels since kernel data is static during execution.

Shared Memory Tiling: Reduces global memory accesses by approximately ~11x.

Profiling: Bottleneck analysis using NVIDIA Nsight.

im2col Transformation:

Converts input images to column format for efficient GEMM.

Implemented in Raw CUDA for GPU and NumPy for CPU verification.

Tensor Core GEMM:

Uses CUDA WMMA API for FP16 tensor operations.

Leverages warp-level matrix multiply-accumulate for high throughput.

Comparison with cuDNN: Baseline performance and correctness checks.

Executable & Library: Can be built as a Linux executable and linkable library.

PyTorch Integration: (Planned) Importable C++/CUDA module.

🛠 Implementation Details

im2col

Converts input image to a padded matrix for GEMM. The GPU kernel is implemented in im2col.cu. For a $5 \times 5$ input and $3 \times 3$ kernel, im2col produces a $9 \times 25$ matrix.

GEMM with Tensor Cores

Implemented in gemm_tensors.cu using the CUDA WMMA API for warp-level matrix multiplication. It supports large matrices (multiples of 16) and utilizes hardware-level acceleration.

Profiling & Testing

Profiling: Nsight used to monitor occupancy, latency, and memory access patterns.

Testing: Validated with synthetic data and MNIST.

Verification: Results are cross-checked against NumPy's convolve for mathematical correctness.

💻 Code Examples

im2col Kernel (CUDA)

__global__ void im2col_kernel(float *image, int C_in, int H_in, int W_in, int im2col_H, int im2col_W, int kernel_size, float *im2col) {
    int row = blockIdx.y * blockDim.y + threadIdx.y;
    int col = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int idx_count = 0;

    if (row < H_in && col < W_in) {
        for (int c = 0; c < C_in; c++) {
            for (int i = -FILTER_RADIUS; i <= FILTER_RADIUS; i++) {
                for (int j = -FILTER_RADIUS; j <= FILTER_RADIUS; j++) {
                    float val = 0.0f;
                    if (col + j >= 0 && col + j < W_in && row + i >= 0 && row + i < H_in) {
                        val = image[c * (H_in * W_in) + (row + i) * W_in + (col + j)];
                    }
                    im2col[IDX2R(idx_count, row * W_in + col, im2col_W)] = val;
                    idx_count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}


GEMM with Tensor Cores (WMMA API)

__global__ void gemm_tensor(half *a, half *b, float *c, int M, int N, int K, float alpha, float beta) {
    // ... (see gemm_tensors.cu for full implementation)
    // Uses nvcuda::wmma for warp-level matrix operations
}
